# Blackbox

Blackbox is your personal, anonymous tip line enabling anyone to privately submit messages that only you can read. 

Our installation is optimized by using an e-paper display to make it a no-code, no-terminal configuration process. 

## Is Blackbox for me?
Blackbox is intended for use when:
1. Control of your physical infrastructure is imperative and you're looking for a Tor-only deployment.
2. You love self-hosting and geek out on stuff like this.

## üéÅ Is Blackbox for sale? 

Yes! Well, soon! We're working on having a special, security-centric cases made - a solid piece of milled alluminum with only the power and ethernet ports exposed. The case is powder coated black with a goregous smoked 5mm plexiglass cover.

While we're hard at work getting Blackbox ready for production, you can assemble your own and create one using the script below:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scidsg/blackbox/main/scripts/helper.sh | bash
```
